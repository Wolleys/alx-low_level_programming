# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

# Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
* You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file

Tasks table

| Task Name  | File Name | Description |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0. 98 Battery st  | `0-reset_to_98.c`  | Take a pointer to an `int` as parameter |
| 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream | `1-swap.c` | Swap the values of two integers |
| 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read | `2-strlen.c` | Return the length of a string |
| 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them | `3-puts.c` | Print a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout` |
| 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear | `4-print_rev.c` | Print a string, in reverse, followed by a new line |
| 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes | `5-rev_string.c` | Reverse a string |
| 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true | `6-puts2.c` | Print every other character of a string |
| 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half | `7-puts_half.c` | Print half of a string, followed by a new line |
| 8. Arrays are not pointers | `8-print_array.c` | Print `n` elements of an array of integers |
| 9. strcpy | `9-strcpy.c` | Copy the string pointed to by `src` |
| 10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers | `100-atoi.c` | Convert a string to an integer |
