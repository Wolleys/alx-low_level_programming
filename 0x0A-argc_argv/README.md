**without the help of Google:**

## General
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

# Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
