# Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` `-pedantic` `-std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use `system`
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

| 1. The last digit | `1-last_digit.c` | Assign a random number to the variable `n` |
| 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game | `2-print_alphabet.c` | Print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line |
| 3. alphABET | `3-print_alphabets.c` | Print the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase |
| 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off | `4-print_alphabt.c` | Print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line |
