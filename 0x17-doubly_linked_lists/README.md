# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
* What is a doubly linked list
* How to use doubly linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

# Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `printf`, `malloc`, `free` and `exit`
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
